Random Walker based Segmentation

This code provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to segment 3D images 
based on the Random Walker algorithm (Grady 2006).  

== Introduction

The current primary aim is to segment White Matter Hyperintensities (WMHI) 
from Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, where WMHI show up 
as bright spots in WM or around the ventricles.  This is a semi-supervised 
method, where an user places foreground and background seeds interactively 
in the image to provide the algorithm with some boundary conditions.  Based 
on these boundary conditions, the RW algorithm simulates a random walk 
process from each voxel under analysis to assign it with the highest 
probability of being a part of either the foreground or background 
(ie being a WMHI or not).  

The outcome is a probability map of the region under analysis, which can 
easily be thresholded to produce a binary mask of WMHI.


== Example:

Load an image:
If you have a nifti image called Flair.nii in the code directory, and you 
have Tools for NIfTI by Jimmy Shen in your path, you can use load_nii.m from
those tools.
>> image3D = load_nii("Flair.nii", 1, [], [], [], [], [], "Q");

Open the RW Toolbox:
>> RW_tool(image3D)

Select a slice to seed by clicking the "Select Slice" button.

Choose a single WMHI to seed.  Left click on it in several locations to place 
foreground seeds inside the lesion.  On the last foreground seed, right 
click; this will switch to placing background seeds with the Left button.
Left click on several voxels near but outside the WMHI to add background 
seeds.  When all your background seeds are in place, right click again to
start the algorithm.  Depending on the size of the lesion you've chosen 
to segment, it should process for a few minutes.  Then the main GUI window
will return and display the results of the segmentation on the right window.

There are some current limitations to the GUI.  Once you place a seed, you 
cannot delete it or move it, but you can remove the last seed you placed
by middle-clicking.  You must first place all your foreground seeds, then
background seeds, and cannot switch between the two.

Repeat until all WMHIs have been segmented, then save and analyze using
your favorite stats package.

This is a work in progress and we welcome your input and feedback.  This is 
free software released under GNU licese. So, Fork away!

directory.
