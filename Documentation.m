%% Help and step by step guide on random walker based segmentation tool
% This documentation explains the random walker based segmentation
% graphical user interface (GUI) and overall procedure for the segmentation
% 
% 
%% Data pre-processing before calling the RW_tool
% The MRI images are available either in DICOM or NIFTI formats. Before
% feeding into the RW_tool we read image data as 3D MATLAB variables
% 
%% Loading a Nifti File into MATLAB 
% You can use anything that will bring the image into the MATLAB workspace
% as a 3D variable. For example, we used the function load_nii.m from
% Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE image by Jimmy Shen, which can be downloaded 
% from 
%%
% <http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image>
% 
% Example:
%% 
% |>>image3D = load_nii("Flair.nii", 1, [], [], [], [], [], "Q");|
%% 
% Alternatively, you can use the built-in mri MATLAB sample dataset:
%%
% |>>load mri|
%%
% % Convert the 4D dataset (D) to 3D:
%%
% |>>image3D(:,:,:) = D(:,:,1,:)|
% 
%% Launching the RW_tool
% The RW_tool requires one input, the image data to be analyzed. To launch 
% the RW_tool type RW_tool(image3D) in MATLAB command prompt. This will 
% bring up the RW Segmentation tool GUI.

%% Understanding the RW Segmentation tool GUI parts
%%
% *Axes*
%%
% The RW Segmentation tool GUI shows two image windows. The left one shows
% the input image with a particular slice displayed and the right one
% shows the segmentation results as a probability map for the same slice.
% 
% 
%% 
% *Toggle buttons*
%%
% * Visualize image -- allows visualization of images
% * Undo            -- restores the segmentation results to previous state
%                     (only one step backward is supported)
% * Select Slice    -- Selects the current slice and calls the random walker
%                     algorithm.
% * Done?           -- Allows the user to declare that s/he is done
%                     segmenting and provides an option to save the results.
% 
% 
%% 
% *Slider bar*
%%
% The slider bar allows navigation between different slices of both input
% image and the results. It displays the first and last slice numbers of
% the 3D image as well as the current slice number. Pressing on arrow marks
% changes the current position by one unit and pressing on the slider body
% changes the current position by ten units.
% 
% 
%% 
% *Buffer*
%%
% * xy-buffer       -- This allows selection of number of voxels in x and y
%                     directions as buffer
% * z-buffer        -- This allows selection of equal number of slices before
%                     and after the current slice
% 
% 
%% Calling the random walker algorithm
%%
%  The Select Slice button calls the randow walker algorithm and displays
%  the current slice on a separate figure window. It asks to select
%  FOREGROUND and BACKGROUND seed points as input to the algorithm. First it
%  asks for the FOREGROUND seeds and then for the background seeds. 
% 
%%
% *What do the 3 mouse buttons do?*
%%  
% * Left   -- picks points.
% * Right  -- picks the last point indicating the end of selection.
% * Middle -- undo last picked point
% 
% 
%% How to put seed points
% The extreme left and right seed points correspond to the minimum and
% maximum x respectively. Similarly, the top and bottom-most seed points
% indicate the minimum and maximum y respectively. xy-buffer is added to
% all four directions to create a bounding box. With this bounding box and
% z-buffer a sub 3D volume is seleted for the analysis. It is therefore
% important trying to select only the region of interest and not too much
% of background to reduce unnecessary computational burden. (Remember our
% segmentation goal is to extract out the region of interest, i.e. the
% FOREGROUND).
